# Brush up

Want to keep sharp with your programming? Here are some resources to brush up
and stay sharp.

[Codewars Kata](https://www.codewars.com/) For intermediate and experienced
programmers to tackle real issues in many languages of their choice. For fun
and is not free labor for some code bounty board. Has leader boards and other
fun things.

[CodeAbbey](http://www.codeabbey.com/) For all levels of programmers easing
into a new language, to help them find what they need to learn about their
language


### Misc tools

[Regexr](https://regexr.com/) Regex is a large part of any programming language.
This lets you write regex easily with quick references and realtime testing
against your custom material.

# Language Specific Learning

## Javascript (JS)
A scripting language used almost exclusively as a web development aid
to make web pages interactive, has general purpose use in the desktop
through an application called [`Node.js`](https://nodejs.org/en/) which
is basically Google Chrome's JS interpreter ripped out and given special
functions to read local files and other useful things.

The Good

- Very easy to learn
- Has some use for tooling
- Massive ecosystem

The Bad

- Absolute mess of a language on a technical level with relatively
little transfer to other languages
- One of the most bustling ecosystems of all languages. Give it 4 months
for your libraries to be replaced with some new hotness, also hard to
get into each area of libraries with up to 8 competitors in each.
- Not quite as fast as other scripting languages without explicit
optimization

## Python (recommended 3.7+)

A pretty do it all general purpose scripting language used in every facet
of programming. This is a powerhouse language that does everything, but almost
never as good as another language would be. Highly recommended first time
language for those who just want to learn one language and be done with it.

The Good

- Very easy to learn
- Extreme use for tooling in every case you can think of
- A large ecosystem but not quite JS big.
- Very fast

The Bad

- Can become very disorganized when creating large projects without
special care.
- In some areas such as GUI programming, a lot of the libs are ports
of C/C++ libraries and might require some experience in setting up a
C compiler to work.
