# Language Specific Learning

## Javascript (JS)
A scripting language used almost exclusively as a web development aid
to make web pages interactive, has general purpose use in the desktop
through an application called [`Node.js`](https://nodejs.org/en/) which
is basically Google Chrome's JS interpreter ripped out and given special
functions to read local files and other useful things.

The Good

- Very easy to learn
- Has some use for tooling
- Massive ecosystem

The Bad

- Absolute mess of a language on a technical level with relatively
little transfer to other languages
- One of the most bustling ecosystems of all languages. Give it 4 months
for your libraries to be replaced with some new hotness, also hard to
get into each area of libraries with up to 8 competitors in each.
